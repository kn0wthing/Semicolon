(COVID-19 QUALITATIVE REAL TIME PCR
_SARS-CoV-2 VIRUS DETECTION BY REAL TIME PCR


Primary Sample:Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal swab in Viral Transport Media.


Methodology: This is a qualtative amplification assay for the detection of the RNA ofSARS-CoV? in respiratory samples. The lab is using FDA/ CE-
1VD] ICMR approved Real Time PCR assay.

















Result:
[TEST NAME JRESULTS
|COVID-19 Virus QUALITATIVE REAL TIME PCR [POSITIVE
Interpretation:





Positive [RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2 Detected
[Negative RNA specific to SARS-CoV-2 Not Detected
InconclusivelThis could be due to low viral load in the sample. A repeat sample is recommended]





‘Background: Several coronaviruses can infect humans, theglobally endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKUL and
HCOV-OC43 thattend to cause mild respiratory disease, and thezoonatic Middle East respiratory syndromecoronavius (MERS-CoV) and severe
acuterespiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) thathave a higher case fatality rate. In December 2019,a cluster of patents with a novel
‘Coronavirus wasidentfied in Wuhan, China. Initially tentativelynamed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),thevirus has now been named SARS-
CCoV-2 by thelnternational Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Ths virus can cause the disease namedcoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19). WHO refersto the virus as COVID-19 virus in ts curentdocumentation.
